Cream.py
========

Crawl through pornhub and download comments.

usage:

./cream.py -url <initial url> -numcomments <max_comments>

initial_url: the initial url to start crawling from. This must be a link to some video on pornhub.
max_comments: the number of comments to read before terminating. In reality the algorithm may terminate before this as it can run out of videos to scrape.
